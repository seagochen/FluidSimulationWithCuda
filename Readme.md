-----------
* When I finished the 2-D CUDA version of CFD demo, I was starting to develop the 3-D version. First of all, I need to fixed the existing bugs in the 2-D.
* A new framework will be used for the new version.

-----------
* A simple CFD demo is now available, more features will be added on. 
* Structure of project still need to be optimized, in order to speed up.
* I will put this code on CUDA devices in the future.
* Currently is only 2D version, 3D will be soon on.

-----------
* Advect, diffuse, line solver methods without boundary conditions. In future, I need to add or modify those boundary conditions to avoid out of memory (array) run-time exception.
